# Braille-Cell-Display-PCB
## Desciption
This is an independent study project. As one of the members of the EE team, we have to implement the Braille Cell Display design of an Industrial Design Students. We decide to use mini motor and PCBs to achieve the goal. My mission is to create two PCB designs with Altium to hold the motor and enable the design to work. The motor PCB is directly attached to the mini motors, and the lower PCB is for the motors to stand on. The pictures are included in the PCB Pic zipped file.
